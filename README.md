# PrivacyLens Fiverr

## Overview

PrivacyLens Fiverr is a Chrome extension designed to enhance your privacy while using Fiverr. As you know fiverr doesn't have an inbuilt balance hider. Which could be pretty annoying when you don't want everyone to see your earning, client information or chat. This extension will help you hide that information with just a click. 

Now available for Firefox as well!
